This software is a computer program whose purpose is to provide an
environment for safe floating-point code development. It is
particularily targeted to the automatized implementation of
mathematical floating-point libraries (libm). Amongst other features,
it offers a certified infinity norm, an automatic polynomial
implementer and a fast Remez algorithm.
